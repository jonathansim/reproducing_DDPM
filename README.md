# Reproducing the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model
This project aims to re-implement the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) in PyTorch, following the original paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239. 
The results will be reproduced on MNIST and preferably on CIFAR as well. 

The project is conducted as part of the course in Deep Learning at the Technical University of Denmark.
